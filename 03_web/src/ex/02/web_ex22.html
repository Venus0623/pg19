  <h1>What to make</h1>
  <p>
    In the case of supervised learning, for example in the case of image recognition, it is useful to have a dataset that can be used for immediate learning, such as the MNIST dataset, simple classification problems, and in the case of clustering the iris dataset.

    In Reinforcement Learning, it's a little bigger framework than a data set, so is it better for the environment? Using OpenAI Gym, you can start reinforcement learning on subjects such as inverted pendulum (CartPole), space invaders, and block breaking.
